class Grabber(object):
    """Manages the downloading and processing of images from webcams.

    Designed to provide a simple base for grabbing images from webcams,
    allowing more complex and bespoke functionality to be added easily
    as needed.

    Attributes:
        url: The publically accessible URL for the webcam image, is likely
            going to be something like: `'http://78.100.133.169:8888/out.jpg'`.

            If using the default (``get_image_from_url()``) download handler,
            it is important the URL is to an actual image (i.e. responds with a
            ``image/jpeg`` content type), not a HTML page displaying or linking
            to the image.

            Only webcams which provide images in JPG format are currently
            supported by the default downloader. If you need more advanced
            functionality, then perhaps write a downloader and pass it to the
            grabber using the ``download_callable`` attribute.

        every: Default = ``2``

            The number of seconds to wait between each attempt at grabbing
            an image. Floats are fine for the number of seconds, so `0.2` will
            attempt to grab an image 5 times a second.

        download_callable: Default = ``get_image_from_url``

            A callable to use for the image downloading. By
            default will use the ``get_image_from_url`` download handler, which
            handles getting images from a simple URL.

            If a different callable is used, it must use the following
            signature::

                def some_callable(url, grabber)

        default_result_handlers: Default = ``(do_save_image, )``

            An iterable of result handlers to use by default. Extra result
            handlers can be set by using the ``extra_result_handlers``
            attribute. Or the result handlers to use can be fully set using
            the ``result_handlers`` attribute.

            If the ``result_handlers`` attribute is set, the
            ``default_result_handlers`` and ``extra_result_handlers``
            attributes will be ignored.

        extra_result_handlers: Default = ``[]``

            A list of extra result handlers to include when processing results.

            If the ``result_handlers`` attribute is set, the
            ``default_result_handlers`` and ``extra_result_handlers``
            attributes will be ignored.

        result_handlers: Default = None

            When set to an iterable of result handlers, will be used in
            preference to the ``default_result_handlers`` and
            ``extra_result_handlers`` attributes, allowing an easy way to
            specify completely which handlers to use.

        save_dir: Default = ``grabbed_images``

            The root directory to save images to. Can be a directory
            relative to the current project, or an absolute path to anywhere
            on the system.

            If the directory does not exist, an attempt will be made to create
            the directory.

            Setting to `None` will prevent images from being saved.

            Supports various tokens for making dynamic directories as needed,
            see below for more information.

        save_filename: Default = ``{Y}{m}{d}/{H}/{Y}{m}{d}-{H}{M}{S}-{f}.jpg``

            The filename to use for each downloaded image.

            Supports various tokens for making dynamic directories as needed,
            see below for more information.

        save: Default = ``True``

            Toggle the actual saving of each downloaded image. Useful when
            using the `send_to_callable` feature to only save images which
            defined by another algorithm. For example, to only save images
            if motion has been detected.

            This setting is dependant upon any result handlers respecting
            the setting.

        timeout: Default = ``30``

            The number of seconds to wait before timing out a connection to a
            webcam.

        ignore_timeout: Default = ``True``

            Whether timeout errors should be ignored.

        ignore_network: Default: ``True``

            Should general network errors (DNS, network unreachable, etc.) be
            ignored?

        ignore_xxx: Default: False

            Whether errors from specific HTTP status codes should be ignored.

            By default, the following are ignored: 500

            When not ignored, HTTP errors will need to be handled (or not) by
            consuming code.

        failed_exception: Default: None

            Set to the exception which causes the ``tick()`` method to crash.
            Is useful for debugging in threaded setups.
